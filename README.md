# U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs
This is my solution for the Codecademy project U.S. Medical Insurance Costs within the Data Science Career Path.

My goal for this project is to identify the mean insurance costs for different categories of people.
1. I will take a look on the mean charges for each sex, and identify if there is a premium for being male or female.
2. The mean charges for each region will be calculated and compared, so I will find out, if there is a premium for a specific region.
3. Next, I will find out if there is a premium for smoking, and how high it is.
4. Finally, I will find out, how the charges change with the BMI.
